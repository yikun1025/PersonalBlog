Hack computer consists of ROM, CPU and RAM.

Nand2Tetris (sometimes written as "From NAND to Tetris" or "The Elements of Computing Systems") is an educational project and course that guides students through building a complete modern computer system from first principles. 

## Core Concept

The fundamental idea behind Nand2Tetris is to build an entire modern computer system - from the basic NAND gate all the way up to a high-level programming language and operating system capable of running games like Tetris. The project follows a bottom-up approach where students construct each layer of the computing hierarchy using only components they've built in previous steps.

Nand2Tetris is widely used in computer science education and has been praised for its integrated approach to teaching computing fundamentals, making it accessible to students with diverse backgrounds while providing deep insights into how modern computers actually work.

`Nand` is the most basic component logic gate.

Engineers using hardware simulator to test scripts. 

week 1: basic logic gate
week2: ALU
week3: register, memory system
Week5: design an computer 

week 4: writing low-level 

### assembly language
- low-level language, not useful as high level language

### Rich language:
- expressions, loop, data types
- classes, methods
- built in operations, I/O math

we need construct a compiler and standard library

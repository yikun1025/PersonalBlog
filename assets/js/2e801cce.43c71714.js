The project follows a bottom-up approach where students construct each layer of the computing hierarchy using only components they\'ve built in previous steps.\\n\\nNand2Tetris is widely used in computer science education and has been praised for its integrated approach to teaching computing fundamentals, making it accessible to students with diverse backgrounds while providing deep insights into how modern computers actually work.\\n\\n`Nand` is the most basic component logic gate.\\n\\nEngineers using hardware simulator to test scripts. \\n\\nweek 1: basic logic gate\\nweek2: ALU\\nweek3: register, memory system\\nWeek5: design an computer \\n\\nweek 4: writing low-level \\n\\n### assembly language\\n- low-level language, not useful as high level language\\n\\n### Rich language:\\n- expressions, loop, data types\\n- classes, methods\\n- built in operations, I/O math\\n\\nwe need construct a compiler and standard library"}]}')}}]);
